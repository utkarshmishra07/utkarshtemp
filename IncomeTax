Observe that you had not updated your PAN at the time of salary processing, hence tax has been deducted. PAN is mandatory. Also, please not that from the month of April to Dec income tax will be computed based on the income tax declaration that is made. From Jan to Mar tax will be computed based on the actual proof that is being submitted. Only then the benefit u/s 87 2A will be given. If you have not made your declaration, request you to kindly make the income tax declaration in the E-payroll. The declaration tool will be opened from 5th to 18th.
